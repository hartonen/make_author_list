# Author List Generator

This repository provides a Bash script that converts two simple text files (one describing authors and their affiliation keys, and another describing affiliation texts with keys) into a formatted scientific paper–style author list with numbered affiliations.

## Files

- `make_author_list.sh` – the script
- `README.md` – this documentation
- Example input files:
  - `authors.txt`
  - `affiliations.txt`

## Usage

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x make_author_list.sh
